# HardwarePerformance.c

This is a simple program that helps calculate how well a computer processor (CPU) performs its tasks. Think of it like a calculator that measures how fast a computer can work. Users can input information about different types of instructions the computer handles, along with how fast the processor runs (its clock speed), and the program will crunch these numbers to show how efficient the system is.

The program works through a simple menu where users can do three main things: enter their data, check what they entered (to make sure there are no mistakes), and see the final performance results. When entering data, users tell the program how many different types of instructions they want to analyze, and for each type, they provide two numbers: how many cycles it takes to complete (CPI) and how many millions of these instructions there are.

After collecting all the information, the program calculates three important measurements: the average number of cycles each instruction takes (Average CPI), how long it takes to run everything (CPU Time in milliseconds), and how many millions of instructions the processor can handle per second (MIPS). These results are shown in a neat table format that's easy to read and understand. It's like getting a report card for your computer's processing speed!
